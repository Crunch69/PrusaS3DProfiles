# Prusa Simplify 3d Profiles for MK2(s) and MK3 Printers
My Simplify 3D Profiles for Prusa MK2(s)/MK3

These started with the default profile in S3D and I made changes for Linear advance and for speeds so far.  I plan to keep these up to date as I continue to make changes to the profiles.  I expect I will need to add a new profile for some filaments as I don't know of another way to alter K values for filament types, as will be needed.

By no means am I claiming this is the best profile to use for S3D with these printers (or even a good one).  I am just storing them on github so other's may make use of them if they like.  If you find settings that work better and wish to submit a pull request with the changes I would welcome that!

Note: MK2 users should avoid using the Temperature Calibration feature for the PINDA probe.   Instead use the new profiles, sbumitted by mariusstrom which use version of this built into the gcode.
