# Prusa Simplify 3d Profiles for MK2(s) and MK3 Printers
My Simplify 3D Profiles for Prusa MK2(s)/MK3

These started with the default profile in S3D and I made changes for Linear advance and for speeds so far.  I plan to keep these up to date as I continue to make changes to the profiles.  I expect I will need to add a new profile for some filaments as I don't know of another way to alter K values for filament types, as will be needed.

I also use this bed model for both printers, until a proper MK3 model can be found:
